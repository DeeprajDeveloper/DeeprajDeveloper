## **A LITTLE ABOUT ME & MY PROFESSION**
I'm an **Automation Tester** and **Test Data Analyst** for the past _3 years_ now. Most of my inspirations and ideas for a well-organized website came to me when I used to test them.  Sometimes the websites are either too outdated or it’s just too cluttered to work with. This made me realize how simple, understandable and easy to use website makes a user’s life easy. It inspires me to finally get certified in UX Design.

Now, I am getting my certification as a UI/UX Developer specializing in UX Design. I make sure to incorporate modernization and simplicity into my design. You can find some recent projects under the Projects section of my website. When I’m offline, I live in Telangana, India with my family.
